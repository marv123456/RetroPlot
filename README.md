## Description

This python script generates a graphical interface to extract data from graphs using calibration curves and linear regressions. It helps users to perform reverse engineering to extrapolate the closest value from the graphed data, using calibration curves. This tool is particularly useful for researchers and engineers who need to retrieve data represented only in graphs and not textually.
